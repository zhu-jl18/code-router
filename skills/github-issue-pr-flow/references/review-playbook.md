# Review Triage Playbook

## Objective
Handle each review comment with an explicit decision: fix or rebut.

## Host Decision Authority
1. Treat all external reviewers as inputs, not as decision owners.
2. Make final fix/rebut decisions from code evidence, test results, and project conventions.
3. Escalate only when ambiguity or risk crosses escalation policy in `../SKILL.md`.

## Rebuttal Template
```markdown
Thanks for the review.

Decision: rebuttal
Reason:
1. <factual evidence>
2. <code path or test evidence>

Verification:
- <test/command/output summary>
```

## Fix Template
```markdown
Thanks for the review.

Decision: accepted and fixed
Changes:
1. <what changed>
2. <why this resolves the concern>

Verification:
- <test/command/output summary>
```

## Triage Checklist
1. Is the reported issue reproducible?
2. Does it violate project constraints or conventions?
3. Is there a smaller fix that preserves scope?
4. Is rebuttal supported by concrete evidence?

## Evidence Priority
1. Reproducible failure and CI breakage
2. Failing or missing tests tied to the finding
3. Concrete code-path impact and runtime risk
4. Reviewer wording or severity label

Never let reviewer label override stronger contradictory evidence.

## Rebuttal Minimum Bar
A rebuttal is acceptable only if it includes:
1. Explicit decision (`rebuttal`) and one-sentence conclusion.
2. At least one falsifiable technical reason (code path, invariant, contract, or test behavior).
3. Verification summary (existing test evidence or rerun result).

## Required Signals Before Triage
Collect these signals with any suitable `gh` query pattern:
1. Review-level summary: `author`, `state`, `submittedAt`, `body` (allow truncated body).
2. Line-level review comments/conversations for actionable findings.
3. Latest check-run states for CI gating.

Do not start fix-or-rebut decisions if review body text is missing.
